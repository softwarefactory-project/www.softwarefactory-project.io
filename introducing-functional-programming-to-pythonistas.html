                <!-- # Introducing Functional Programming to Pythonistas --><p>This year, I continued my journey through computer science by learning
functional programming. I started using functional programming (FP)
through emacs lisp, then scheme with the SICP book, until I discovered
Haskell, which is arguably the best language to learn FP concepts. There
I discovered software designs that provide elegant solutions to some of
the problems my team and I are facing.</p>
<p>This post documents why I introduced FP to my team, and what strategies
I used. But first, let's define the FP paradigms.</p>
<div class="section" id="functional-programming-paradigms">
<h2>Functional programming paradigms</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>FP is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by
applying and composing functions.</li>
<li>FP is declarative programming. Instead of using statements to change
the program's state, FP expresses the logic of a computation without
describing its control flow.</li>
<li>FP is built on proven general purpose theories such as lambda
calculus and abstract algebra.</li>
<li>FP enables a strong type system. While some FP languages like LISP do
not feature such type systems, I am refering to FP languages using
<tt class="docutils literal">System F</tt> which enable a powerful and always correct types
inference.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about these paradigms, I recommend Richard Feldman's talk
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YbK8o9rZfI">The Next Paradigm Shift in Programming</a> and Gabriel Gonzales's post
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2020/10/why-i-prefer-functional-programming.html">Why I prefer FP</a>.</p>
<p>With that definition out of the way, the next section explains the
advantages of FP paradigms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reasons-to-use-functional-programming">
<h2>Reasons to use functional programming</h2>
<p>As Michael Snoyman explains in his <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7QETok5hYI">Economic Argument for Functional
Programming</a> talk, FP benefits include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Reduce code review time.</li>
<li>Consistent interface and reduced bug count by combining general
purpose concepts.</li>
<li>Remove classes of bugs entirely, reducing testing burden, QA can
focus on higher impact bugs.</li>
<li>Motivate development, leading to better staff retention and easier
recruiting.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular there are three areas in which I am looking for solutions:</p>
<div class="section" id="development-cycle">
<h3>Development cycle</h3>
<p>When we update our software we rely on extensive tests to check the
code. These tests may take hours to complete, resulting in a long
feedback loop. FP may provide a faster feedback loop to improve our
productivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reusability">
<h3>Reusability</h3>
<p>When we integrate software to build services, we are often dealing with
a complex stack of components that do not share or re-use common
computations. For example, we have many independent TLS setup
implementations. Such components rely on complex state management that
is difficult to compose. FP provides effective tools to define and
re-use the common computations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-operations">
<h3>System operations</h3>
<p>When we operate software, we are often faced with runtime errors such as
AttributeError or ReferenceError. For example, when we restart our CI
scheduler, we may not be able to re-enqueue some changes when they are
in an undefined state. This kind of issue is nasty because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The underlying bugs are hard to debug.</li>
<li>Operating the software in production is stressful.</li>
<li>Even though we spend a lot of time and energy to prevent those
issues, they can still occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>FP may result in lower bug counts to increase reliability.</p>
<p>However, learning FP has a significant cost of its own. The next section
describes the strategies I used to introduce FP.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-new-concepts">
<h2>Introducing new concepts</h2>
<p>As my team works remotely, I proposed that we set a weekly online event
to spend some time together. Without a specific goal, I meant to create
a fun and relaxed space where we would collaborate outside of our day to
day activities. We used a shared remote desktop environment so that the
whole team would see and use the same tools.</p>
<p>This event is not dedicated to FP and each members can propose a
subject. For example, we did a couple of sessions on using GraphQL. We
used two different setups for one to two hours long session:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Code kata where the presenter would perform a software development
exercise, explaining each concept along the way.</li>
<li>Mob programming where the presenter would not drive the session.
Instead, each participant would discuss and tell the presenter what
to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Introducing new concepts is more difficult than I anticipated and I
could have spend more time learning pedagogical techniques. In
particular, there is a methodology where the presenter asks the
attendees to generate questions (<a class="reference external" href="https://rightquestion.org/what-is-the-qft/">QFT</a>) which seems very effective.
Finding the right question focus and raise interest takes a lot of time,
even for professional educators.</p>
<p>The next sections describes each concept I introduced over the year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-function-composition">
<h2>Introducing function composition</h2>
<div class="section" id="why">
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Function composition is a mechanism that combines two functions. It is
similar to object inheritance or object composition, but uses general
purpose primitives that can be applied to a large set of problems. In
particular, using function composition results in a more consistent
interface compared to stateful objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how">
<h3>How</h3>
<p>I shared Scott Wlaschin's talk <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhEkBCWpDas">The Power of Composition</a> and looked
for practical use-cases in our code base. For example, instead of
writing this computation:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">build</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">get_builds</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">build</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;NODE_FAILURE&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">continue</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log_url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>I would suggest using this function composition:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">completed_build</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">build</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;NODE_FAILURE&quot;</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log_url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

<span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">process</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">completed_build</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get_builds</span><span class="p">())))</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits">
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Break a computation in smaller pieces.</li>
<li>Re-use common functions like <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">filter</tt>.</li>
<li>More declarative.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Thinking in terms of function composition requires a change in habit,
though I think this first concept is easy to introduce. A colleague even
started to use <tt class="docutils literal">functools.reduce</tt> when <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt> was not enough.</p>
<p>I recommend Julien Danjou's post <a class="reference external" href="https://julien.danjou.info/python-and-functional-programming/">An Introduction to Functional
Programming with Python</a> as a follow-up.</p>
<p>To build up on function composition, I then introduced pure functions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-pure-function">
<h2>Introducing pure function</h2>
<div class="section" id="why-2">
<span id="why-1"></span><h3>Why</h3>
<p>For a given input, a pure function always produces the same output.
Thus, it is possible to truly study and understand such functions
independently from others and they provide a solid building block for
complex computations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-2">
<span id="how-1"></span><h3>How</h3>
<p>I introduced Haskell for a small side project where we needed a new
service to forward statsd metrics from UDP packets to two backends:
telegraph and prometheus. We implemented the service in Python
(<a class="reference external" href="https://softwarefactory-project.io/cgit/software-factory/sf-infra/tree/roles/udp-multiplexer/files/udp-multiplexer.py?id=e3eea281571325f1ccb282391613f0035adc121c">source</a>) and Haskell
(<a class="reference external" href="https://softwarefactory-project.io/cgit/software-factory/sf-infra/tree/roles/udp-multiplexer/files/udp-multiplexer.hs?id=e3eea281571325f1ccb282391613f0035adc121c">source</a>)
in pair programming.</p>
<p>Then I wrote a couple of blog posts about the language: <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/getting-started-with-haskell-on-fedora/">Getting Started
with Haskell on Fedora</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/haskell-for-python-developers.html">Haskell for python developpers</a>. I also
demonstrated how we could use the language for other use-cases such as
documentation management and software factory packages update.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-2">
<span id="benefits-1"></span><h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Haskell features state-of-the-art programming paradigms.</li>
<li>Small footprint, the service has been running continuously without
any issues.</li>
<li>More robust, the Haskell network library reports when UDP packets are
not being delivered, something we were not able to achieve with
Python.</li>
<li>Short development cycle where most of the bugs are prevented by the
compiler.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-2">
<span id="results-1"></span><h3>Results</h3>
<p>There is a lot going on in Haskell and there is a steep learning curve.
Learning Haskell is a significant investment and the project I used to
introduce the language was too small to allow for the team to gain
adequate experience using the language. Though new projects are a good
opportunity to explore new languages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-monadic-function">
<h2>Introducing monadic function</h2>
<div class="section" id="why-3">
<span id="why-2-1"></span><h3>Why</h3>
<p>As Graham Hutton states in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1e8gqXLbsU">What is a Monad?</a> computerphile video,
Monad is one of the most important developments in programming languages
in the last twenty-eight years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-3">
<span id="how-2-1"></span><h3>How</h3>
<p>I introduced the concept through a code kata using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf">Monadic Parser
Combinators</a> paper to implement a RPM spec file parser. I went through
the paper by re-implementing each functions in pure Python. Then I
showed how the same concepts can be used for error handling and to
manage side effects.</p>
<p>I also presented a couple of Python libraries such as <tt class="docutils literal">toolz</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">effect</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-3">
<span id="benefits-2-1"></span><h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Monad is a general purpose building block that can be applied for many,
if not all, computations. Combined with pure functions, monads enable a
clean composition for effectful computations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-3">
<span id="results-2-1"></span><h3>Results</h3>
<p>Explaining this concept from the ground up is a difficult exercise and
using an existing combinator library might have been a better strategy.
Moreover, Python is not the most ergonomic language to write purely
functional style code, resulting in non idiomatic implementations.</p>
<p>Even though pure monadic functions did not spark much joy for my team,
there is still a lot to learn from FP. Thus, I switched gears to the
more practical type system concept.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-type-system-and-immutability">
<h2>Introducing type system and immutability</h2>
<div class="section" id="why-4">
<span id="why-3-1"></span><h3>Why</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental purpose of a type system is to prevent the occurrence
of execution errors during the running of a program.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Luca Cardelli</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-4">
<span id="how-3-1"></span><h3>How</h3>
<p>Since python version 3.6, we can add type annotations and use the
<tt class="docutils literal">mypy</tt> type checker. So instead of using such object:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_build</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;SUCCESS&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">log_url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://example&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>I would suggest to use a <tt class="docutils literal">dataclass</tt>:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="nd">&#64;dataclass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">frozen</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Build</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">status</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span>
    <span class="n">log_url</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_build</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Build</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Build</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;SUCCESS&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://example&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>I performed a code kata on dataclass and wrote a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/python-dataclasses.html">blog post</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-4">
<span id="benefits-3-1"></span><h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Type checker may prevent runtime errors.</li>
<li>Re-usable, a library providing dataclass is safer to use.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-4">
<span id="results-3-1"></span><h3>Results</h3>
<p>This was well received and the benefit of <tt class="docutils literal">mypy</tt> is quite practical,
but dataclasses are difficult to introduce in an existing code base.
Thus, we were not able to benefit much from it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-strong-type-system">
<h2>Introducing strong type system</h2>
<div class="section" id="why-5">
<span id="why-4-1"></span><h3>Why</h3>
<p>A strong type system provides stronger safety and definitely excludes
certain classes of programming errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-5">
<span id="how-4-1"></span><h3>How</h3>
<p>I presented algebraic data type to enable type composition in the form
of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sum (union)</li>
<li>Product (record)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the previous build type can also be defined as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
data build = Error | Success(log_url)
</pre>
<p>For another side project, I presented different languages featuring a
strong type system: PureScript, ELM and ReasonML. We picked ReasonML as
the team was already familiar with React, and I wrote a blog post about
this choice: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/software-factory-resources-in-reason.html">Software Factory Resources in Reason</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-5">
<span id="benefits-4-1"></span><h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Easier to review and maintain.</li>
<li>Safer dependencies updates, most breaking changes are prevented by
the compiler.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-5">
<span id="results-4-1"></span><h3>Results</h3>
<p>Even though we applied this concept to a web application, using a strong
type system was a very valuable experience. We could have used Python
with some tricks, for example, by enabling the <tt class="docutils literal">strict</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disallow-any-expr</span></tt> options. This is impractical because Python is
dearly missing support for tagged union and pattern matching.</p>
<p>To learn more about strong type systems, I recommend watching this talk
by Jane Street: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ1P8cHN3pY">Why Functional Programming Doesn't Matter</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-programmable-configuration">
<h2>Introducing programmable configuration</h2>
<div class="section" id="why-6">
<span id="why-5-1"></span><h3>Why</h3>
<p>Using a general purpose configuration DSL such as Dhall enables a
functional approach to configuration management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-6">
<span id="how-5-1"></span><h3>How</h3>
<p>Instead of using a data serialization language like JSON or YAML, I
introduced the Dhall language to define our configurations.</p>
<p>In the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sf-infra</span></tt> project, where we define our infrastructure, I
showed how by using Dhall records we could define resources such as
servers, volumes, and networks. Then I showed how we could use functions
to transform those records into configurations such as the inventory or
the monitoring, and how we can re-use those resources in other projects.</p>
<p>For the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zuul-operator</span></tt> I wrote a Dhall function to convert the high
level definition of a Zuul service into a collection of Kubernetes
resources and ConfigMap.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-6">
<span id="benefits-5-1"></span><h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Prevents runtime error, configuration is tested and valid by
construction.</li>
<li>Enables configuration refactoring.</li>
<li>Fosters re-use through a powerful dependency and import system.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-6">
<span id="results-5-1"></span><h3>Results</h3>
<p>Adopting a new syntax for configuration is a major difficulty. Though I
showed how this functional language can be used for all our
configuration needs, such as Kubernetes resources, container
definitions, CI pipelines and Ansible playbooks.</p>

<p>To capture knowledge in a way that is understandable for both the
computer and humans, now and in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-7">
<span id="how-6-1"></span><h3>How</h3>
<p>Comparing with object's names, documentations and tests, I showed how
type annotation could capture the knowledge more effectively.</p>
<p>In the context of a couple of mob programming sessions, we added types
to undocumented code, resulting in an insightful documentation. Then by
increasing the type coverage, we were able to refine the initial
knowledge of the code.</p>
<p>We used the <tt class="docutils literal">TypedDict</tt> annotation to incrementally document the
<tt class="docutils literal">distroinfo</tt> library output.</p>

<span id="benefits-6-1"></span><h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Incremental, each modification adds knowledge.</li>
<li>Mypy verifies the knowledge is correct.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="results-7">
<span id="results-6-1"></span><h3>Results</h3>
<p>This concept is relatively easy to demonstrate and it yielded the most
engagement from my team.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Introducing new concepts can be an exhausting process. Most pragmatic
engineers are likely to push back against new ideas, particularly when
they induce friction. As an example, even early languages like Fortran
were frowned upon by traditional binary bytecodes authors. Von Neuman
himself was apparently getting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/index.html">angry</a> when his students used such
language instead of writing the bytecode by hand.</p>
<p>FP vocabulary includes many unfamiliar words like curry, functor or
cons. These words refer to the underlying concept and I think this is
great to properly acknowledge what those things are. However, this
causes additional friction and using more familiar words would have been
a better choice to begin with.</p>
<p>Object oriented programming is still one of the most widely used
paradigm, and even though it is fairly <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Criticism">criticized</a>, it is the
preferred paradigms in Python. Thus, embracing FP in Python may not be
the best strategy and using a more appropriate language like OCaml or
Haskell would be ideal.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, even if FP concepts are not applied directly,
they can significantly improve non-FP development.</p>
