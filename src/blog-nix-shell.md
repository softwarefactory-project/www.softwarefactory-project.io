This post aims to teach how to leverage nix via the nix-shell feature in order to ease
the distribution of reproducible environment.

## What is Nix ?

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a purely functional package manager. It manages packages independently from your
system by maintaining a package store in `/nix/store`. This makes Nix convenient because
various softwares and libraries can be installed without the fear to break the base
system provided by your Linux distribution. Furthermore, as the Nix store is a graph
of cryptographic hashes of packageâ€™s build dependencies, then it brings the guaranty of
reproducible environments.

## How to install nix

This page describes [installation instructions](https://nixos.org/download.html#download-nix).

We'll use the single user installation process (the user needs to be able to `sudo -i`):

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
. ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
````

Now let's verify our nix installation is working as expected:

```
nix --version
nix (Nix) 2.12.0
```

## Using the nix-shell to setup an environment

A Nix shell environment gives access to specified packages.

For instance, this command enhances the current shell enviroment to make `cowsay` and `fortune`
available in the PATH:

```
$ nix-shell -p cowsay fortune
these 3 paths will be fetched (1.76 MiB download, 6.34 MiB unpacked):
  /nix/store/4agvv4d3jl9lcwxd46qjlkzcibsbryvz-recode-3.7.9
  /nix/store/fkrh0bzwymq0220fscz7grd3yrh5hzsd-cowsay-3.04
  /nix/store/k5dfq7qj0vp10jyb2pn780f323f4vdzm-fortune-mod-3.6.1
copying path '/nix/store/fkrh0bzwymq0220fscz7grd3yrh5hzsd-cowsay-3.04' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...
copying path '/nix/store/4agvv4d3jl9lcwxd46qjlkzcibsbryvz-recode-3.7.9' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...
copying path '/nix/store/k5dfq7qj0vp10jyb2pn780f323f4vdzm-fortune-mod-3.6.1' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...

$ type cowsay fortune
cowsay is hashed (/nix/store/fkrh0bzwymq0220fscz7grd3yrh5hzsd-cowsay-3.04/bin/cowsay)
fortune is hashed (/nix/store/k5dfq7qj0vp10jyb2pn780f323f4vdzm-fortune-mod-3.6.1/bin/fortune)
```

The Nix project maintains a binary cache then packages are usually just downloaded from the cache.

However this command does not guaranty that the same versions of packages will be installed
when the same command runs on another machine. Indeed package definitions are maintained in the
[nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) project, and to ensure reproducibility the version
of nixpkgs must be pinned.

By default, running `nix-shell`, uses the default nixpkgs channel, which might be set to a different
version across nix installations.

```
$ nix-instantiate --eval -E '(import <nixpkgs> {}).lib.version'
"23.05pre440754.0c9aadc8eff"
````

The `nix-shell` command can be run with a pinned version of nixpkgs, by doing so we get the guaranty
to run a reproducible shell environment:

```
$ nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/refs/tags/22.11.tar.gz -p cowsay
```

Now let use our new knowledges to get a Python 3.9 shell with various Python libraries and
ipython:

```
$ nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/refs/tags/22.11.tar.gz -p \
python39 python39Packages.tox python39Packages.flake8 python39Packages.requests \
python39Packages.ipython

$ type python tox flake8 ipython    
python is /nix/store/h4h5rxs0hzpzvz37yrwv1k2na1acgzww-python3-3.9.15/bin/python
tox is hashed (/nix/store/0iifww8anqsg84apj0dklrpiqjwn1nzy-python3.9-tox-3.27.1/bin/tox)
flake8 is hashed (/nix/store/mri6xdgqa5b4hj7by88mlidksi1h7kd2-python3.9-flake8-5.0.4/bin/flake8)
ipython is /nix/store/1kgkssy7lkgsxpjii618ddjq2v03473x-python3.9-ipython-8.4.0/bin/ipython

$ python --version && flake8 --version && tox --version && ipython --version
Python 3.9.15
5.0.4 (mccabe: 0.7.0, pycodestyle: 2.9.1, pyflakes: 2.5.0) CPython 3.9.15 on Linux
3.27.1 imported from /nix/store/0iifww8anqsg84apj0dklrpiqjwn1nzy-python3.9-tox-3.27.1/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tox/__init__.py
8.4.0

$ exit

# Note that running again the nix-shell command will enter the shell instantanously as all
# binaries have been fetched into /nix/store already.
```

If you try the same commands as above on your machine you should see the extact same output.

Currenlty, nixpkgs owns definitions for around 80,000 packages. You can search for available packages
on [search.nixos.org](https://search.nixos.org).

## A simple shell.nix definition

The `nix-shell` command looks for a `shell.nix` file in the current directory and if it exists
the shell environment is loaded. This is handy in order to share with co-workers a common and
reproducible work environment for a given project.

As the most simple example of `shell.nix` to deploy the previous Python environment: 

```
{ pkgs ? import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/refs/tags/22.11.tar.gz") {} }:

let fooScript = pkgs.writeScriptBin "foo.sh" ''
  #!/bin/sh
  echo $FOO
'';

in pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "My-project build environment";
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.python39
    pkgs.python39Packages.tox
    pkgs.python39Packages.flake8
    pkgs.python39Packages.requests
    pkgs.python39Packages.ipython
    fooScript
  ];
  shellHook = ''
    echo "Welcome in $name"
    export FOO="BAR"
  '';
}
```

Then run `nix-shell`.

## To go further

In this post we learnt the basic to bootstrap simple shell environments with Nix. However
more complex and reproducible environment setups can be built via a Nix shell, like
the setup of services (MariaDB, Zookeeper, ...), installation of additional scripts,
compilation/installation of softwares and libraries not available in nixpkgs, but this
go beyond that simple introdution.

Here are some interesting resources to [continue your learning](https://nix.dev/recommended-reading).
