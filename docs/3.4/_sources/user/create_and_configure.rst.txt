Create and configure a new project
----------------------------------

Creating a new project or repository is done by submitting a change on the
:ref:`Config repository <config-repo>`. This repository is a regular project,
see the :ref:`next chapter <contribute>` about how to contribute to a project.

To create and/or configure a project, you need to create a new review on the config
repository. Please see :ref:`this example<project-example>`.

Once the change is approved and merged, the project will be created/updated and
added to the Zuul tenant configuration.
