Collaborative tools
-------------------

Software Factory deploys a collection of tools that can ease sharing information
within a team:

* `Etherpad <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etherpad>`_ where team members can
  edit text documents synchronously to collaborate. This is really handy for instance to
  brainstorm or design drafts together.

* `Lodgeit <http://www.pocoo.org/projects/lodgeit/>`_ is a pastebin-like tool
  that helps sharing code snippets, error stack traces, anything text-based that
  does not need edition.

  chat software. Software Factory provides the server out of the box, users have
