Can I disable Gerrit ?
----------------------

Gerrit can be removed from the standard architecture. In that case, the
config and jobs repositories are created locally using bare git.

The config and jobs repositories can be hosted on an external gerrit or github,
For example see the :ref:`github_deployment` guide.
