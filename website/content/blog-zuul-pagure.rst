Zuul Pagure Driver Update

Zuul brings lots of advanced features for Continuous Integration and deserves to
be usable by more projects, I decided to start the implementation of a Pagure
driver for Zuul.

Zuul
----

Zuul is a powerful gating system that helps project maintainers to never break
development branches. Thanks to unique features such as speculative merging and
support for dependencies between repositories, Zuul leverages CI at scale. It also
provides out the box support for Ansible (Zuul jobs are Ansible playbooks).
Currently Zuul interfaces with Gerrit and Github as input sources. To learn more
about Zuul you can access `the Zuul website <https://zuul-ci.org/>`_ and
`the Zuul Hands-on blog post series <https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/zuul-hands-on-part-1-what-is-zuul.html>`_.

Pagure
------

Pagure is a git-centered forge written in Python, mainly but not only
used by the Fedora project. The pagure API provides most of the features needed
by Zuul to gate Pull-Requests. You can see Pagure in action `here <https://pagure.io/browse/projects/>`_
and learn more about it on `the project's page <https://pagure.io/pagure>`_.

Pagure is quite similar to Github as it handles Pull-Requests, where a PR is a branch
composed of one or more commits. A PR can be commented, reviewed, updated,
CI flagged, and merged via the API. CI results for a PR are reported via the
flag mechanism (success/failure/pending). Code review is done via comments with
a :thumbsup: or a :thumbsdown: emoji. Pagure computes a score based on those emoji
and only permits a maintainer to merge a PR if *that score beats a minimum value set in
the repository's settings*. Pagure publishes repository events via web hooks and provides
repository API tokens to perform authenticated calls like merging a PR or adding
a CI flag.

The Zuul Pagure driver
----------------------

Here is a link to the patch on OpenStack's code review server: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/604404/.
It provides, for a single repository, a check/gate/post workflow and has been validated
with Pagure's current master branch at the time of writing (future Pagure 5.2).

The driver makes use of the web hooks to receive repository events such as
*Pull Request Opened* or *Pull Request Commented*. Events are received via Zuul
Web and sent to the Zuul scheduler. The driver is able to read Pull-Requests
status to get the Review score via the count of :thumbsup:/:thumbsdown:
emoji, the CI status (flags) and the merge state. It is also able to set CI status
and Pull-Request comments.

The driver provides **Triggers** and **Requires** filter attributes that can be used
to define a Zuul pipeline. Below is an example of a Zuul pipeline for a Pagure
source called *pagure.sftests.com*:

.. code-block:: yaml

 - pipeline:
     name: check
     manager: independent
     require:
      pagure.sftests.com:
         merged: False
     trigger:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         - event: pg_pull_request
           action: comment
           comment: (?i)^\s*recheck\s*$
         - event: pg_pull_request
           action:
             - opened
             - changed
     start:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         status: 'pending'
         comment: false
       sqlreporter:
     success:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         status: 'success'
       sqlreporter:
     failure:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         status: 'failure'
       sqlreporter:

 - pipeline:
     name: gate
     manager: dependent
     precedence: high
     require:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         score: 1
         merged: False
         status: success
       sqlreporter:
     trigger:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         - event: pg_pull_request
           action: status
           status: success
         - event: pg_pull_request_review
           action: thumbsup
     start:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         status: 'pending'
         comment: false
       sqlreporter:
     success:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         status: 'success'
         merge: true
         comment: true
       sqlreporter:
     failure:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         status: 'failure'
         comment: true
       sqlreporter:

 - pipeline:
     name: post
     post-review: true
     manager: independent
     precedence: low
     trigger:
       pagure.sftests.com:
         - event: pg_push
           ref: ^refs/heads/.*$
     success:
       sqlreporter:

Currently three type of events can be used as triggers in pipelines:

- pg_pull_request: when a Pull-Request change
- pg_pull_request_review: when a comment is added to a Pull-Request
- pg_push: when a git branch is updated

The following requirements are supported:

- merged: the Pull-Request merged status
- status: the CI flag success/failure/pending
- score: the score based on thumbsup/thumbsdown count

First PR gated by Zuul on pagure.io

Setting up a Pagure repository for Zuul
---------------------------------------

The API token ACLs must allow at least:

- Comment on a pull-request
- Flag a pull-request
- Merge a pull-request

The web hook target must be (in repository settings):

- http://<zuul-web>/zuul/api/connection/<conn-name>/payload

The repository settings to be set:

- Always merge (? better to match internal merge strategy of Zuul)
- Minimum score to merge Pull-Request
- Notify on Pull-Request flag
- Pull-Requests

The connection to define in /etc/zuul/zuul.conf:

.. code-block:: ini

  [connection pagure.sftests.com]
  driver=pagure
  webhook_token=XXXXX
  server=pagure.sftests.com
  baseurl=https://pagure.sftests.com/pagure
  cloneurl=https://pagure.sftests.com/pagure/git
  api_token=YYYYY

Current issues
--------------

Here is the list of the issues that currently prevent the driver to provide the
same capabilities as the Gerrit and Github drivers.

Blocking issues
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- API token, webhook target and hook payload signature are set by repository.
  This makes difficult to support multiple repositories like in Gerrit or Github.
  An idea could be to group projects and set those settings at project's group
  level. There is an open RFE for this: https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/3948

Non blocking issues
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- Pagure does not send an event when a git tag is added/removed
- Pagure does not send an event when a branch is created
- Pagure does not send an event when a branch is deleted
- Repository API tokens seem to expire after 60 days
- The Git-receive hook payload does not contain the list of commits that are a part
  of the merged PR with a detail of the files. An extra call to the merger is needed
  to detect if a .zuul.yaml exists at the root of the reporitory file tree.
- Pagure does not reset the review score when a PR code is updated.
  There is an open RFE for this: https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/3985
- CI status flag's *updated* field unit is the second, it'd be better to have
  values to the millisecond, in order to avoid sorting issues when statuses are
  changed in the span of a second.
- Zuul needs to be able to search commits that set a dependency (depends-on)
  to a specific commit to reset jobs run when a dependency is changed. On
  Gerrit and Github, searching through commit messages is possible and used by
  Zuul. Pagure does not offer this feature.

Follow up
---------

- Showcase the driver to the Pagure folks
- Implement https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/3948
- Write the driver's unit tests and documentation
- By Pagure 5.3, have a multi-repository (depends-on) workflow working

Any help welcome :)
