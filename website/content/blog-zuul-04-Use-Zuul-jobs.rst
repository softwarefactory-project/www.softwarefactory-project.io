In this article, we will:

- provision a python project with a test suite based on tox
- explain how to use the `zuul-jobs library <https://github.com/openstack-infra/zuul-jobs>`_ in
  order to benefit from jobs maintained by the Zuul community.

This article is part of the `Zuul hands-on series <{tag}zuul-hands-on-series>`_.

Note that most of the links reference *sftests.com* which is the default domain of the sandbox
documented in the *How to setup a Software Factory sandbox* blog post. Make sure to adapt the
links if necessary.

The examples and commands are intended to be run on a Software Factory
sandbox where a **demo-repo** repository exists. You should have such an environment
after following the previous articles in this series:

- To deploy a Software Factory sandbox please read the `first article of the series <{filename}/blog-zuul-01-setup-sandbox.rst>`_.
- To create the **demo-repo** repository, please follow the sections `Clone the config repository <{filename}/blog-zuul-03-Gate-a-first-patch.rst#clone-the-config-repository>`_
  and `Define the demo-repo repository <{filename}/blog-zuul-03-Gate-a-first-patch.rst#define-the-demo-repo-repository>`_ sections.

If you have already deployed a Software Factory sandbox and created a snapshot as
suggested, you can restore this snapshot to follow this article on a clean environment.
In that case make sure the system date of your virtual machine is correct post
restoration. If not fix it by running

.. code-block:: bash

  systemctl stop ntpd; ntpd -gq; systemctl start ntpd

The Zuul Jobs Library
.....................

By design Zuul promotes reusability in its approach to jobs. In that spirit, a
public jobs library is available at `git.zuul-ci.org <https://git.zuul-ci.org>`_.

The library contains jobs that can be used directly as is, and more elementary
roles that can be included into your own playbooks.

As of now the **zuul-jobs** library covers mainly typical CI or
CD needs for Python and Javascript projects, for example:

- publishing a package to PyPI
- tox tests
- npm commands
- documentation building with Sphinx

Zuul however can support CI and CD for any language, and the library is a good
source of examples to start from when writing your own jobs. And if your jobs
are generic enough, do not hesitate to
`contribute upstream <http://git.zuul-ci.org/cgit/zuul-jobs/>`_ to enrich the library.

Provision the demo-repo source code
....................................

Clone **demo-repo** and provision it with `this demo code <{filename}/demo-codes/hoz-4-demo-repo.tgz>`_ .

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone -c http.sslVerify=false https://sftests.com/r/demo-repo
  cd demo-repo
  git review -s # Enter admin as username
  tar -xzf /tmp/hoz-4-demo-repo.tgz -C .

This will add a **tox ini file** to the repository, so unittests can be started
by running tox (obviously, make sure you have tox installed on your system first).

.. code-block:: bash

  tox

If you went through the third article of the series to the end, remove also
the previous jobs and pipelines definitions, and the now useless hello.py file:

.. code-block:: bash

  git rm -r playbooks .zuul.yaml hello.py

Push the code to the **demo-repo** repository. Note that we don't use **git review**
here to bypass the review process of Gerrit. We will reconfigure the CI later.

.. code-block:: bash

  git add -A
  git commit -m"Initialize demo-repo project"
  git push gerrit


Use zuul-jobs tox jobs
......................

Software Factory bundles a copy of the upstream zuul-jobs library. You can
browse zuul-jobs's `source code (sftests.com) <https://sftests.com/r/gitweb?p=zuul-jobs.git;a=tree>`_ and
its `documentation (sftests.com) <https://sftests.com/docs/zuul-jobs/>`_.

As the **demo-repo** source code comes with a tox file we can benefit from
the **tox-py27** and **tox-pep8** jobs defined in **zuul-jobs**.

In **demo-repo**, create the file **.zuul.yaml**:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - project:
      check:
        jobs:
          - tox-py27
          - tox-pep8
      gate:
        jobs:
          - tox-py27
          - tox-pep8

Then submit the change on Gerrit:

.. code-block:: bash

  git add .zuul.yaml
  git commit -m"Init demo-repo pipelines"
  git review

Both jobs will be started in parallel by Zuul, as can be seen in the
`status (sftests.com) <https://sftests.com/zuul/t/local/status>`_ page.

.. image:: images/zuul-hands-on-part4-c1.png

When the jobs are completed, the produced artifacts will be stored on the log
server as usual. Along with the expected console log, inventory file and ARA report,
you will also find the logs of the execution stages of tox in the **tox**
directory.

This concludes this article on how to use the zuul jobs library with your projects.

To use the upstream version of the Zuul jobs library instead of
the one embedded in Software Factory, you can do so by following the steps described in this
`configuration section (sftests.com) <https://sftests.com/docs/operator/zuul_operator.html#use-openstack-infra-zuul-jobs>`_.

Stay tuned for the next article.
