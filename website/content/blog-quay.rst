What is Quay ?
==============

A distributed and highly available container image registry.

Additional services
===================

The Quay service can communicate with additional services:

- `clair <https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-clair>` - is an open source project which provides a tool to monitor the
  security of your containers through the static analysis of vulnerabilities
  in appc and docker containers. [1].
- `quay-mirror <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay>` - it is a service
  that provides mirroring functionality of external repository and pull
  it into current one.


How to deploy ?
===============

The service can be deployed by using dedicated role provided in `software-factory/sf-infra project<https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/software-factory/sf-infra/+/refs/heads/master/roles/rdo/quay/>`
It deploys automatically required services such as:

- reddis - an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed,
  in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with
  optional durability,
- PostgreSQL - open source object-relational database.


Below there is an example of the playbook how to deploy Quay with
Clair service and Quay mirror.

NOTE: Only admin user has password with at least 8 characters.
Other users password is generated on creating the superuser account.

NOTE: To generate token for an organization, after creating a superuser
account, login into the Quay as this user, create new organization: "config",
then inside the organization "config", create new application "admin_token",
with "Administer Organization" permissions.

.. raw:: yaml

  - hosts: quay.dev
    vars:
      fqdn: quay.dev
      self_signed_certs: true
      initial_config: false
      quay_validate_cert: false
      # NOTE: password needs to be at least 8 characters
      quay_users:
        admin:
          email: admin@somemail.com
          password: password
          token: ""
        someuser:
          email: someuser@someemail.com
          token: ""
    tasks:
      - name: Setup quay
        include_role:
          name: quay
          tasks_from: main.yml
    roles:
      - hostname


Quay - organizations, users, roles...
=====================================

Quay components
---------------

- organizations -organizations provide a way of sharing repositories
  under a common namespace that does not belong to a single user,
  but rather to many users in a shared setting (such as a company),
- teams - organizations are organized into a set of Teams which provide
  access to a subset of the repositories under that namespace.
  Teams have defined global permissions in the organization: member, creator
  and admin. More info `here <https://docs.quay.io/glossary/teams.html>`,
- users - it is a user account that later would connect to the Quay
  by using for example: `podman login` command,
- robots - it is an account which can be shared by multiple repositories
  that are owned by a user organization. That account might be helpful,
  when you create new container images in CI and you would like just to push
  the content to the repository,
- prototypes - it is default permissions in the organization,
- applications - it generates an API `token` possible permissions:
    * administer organization,
    * administer repositories,
    * create repositories,
    * view all visible repositories,
    * read/write to any accessible repositories,
    * super user access,
    * administer user,
    * read user information.

  The applications can be used by for example `pruner` script, to
  set expiration time to the image.
- tokens - a string that can communicate with Quay API that have
  already configured permissions.

Quay user automation
====================

Python Quay tool
----------------

The Python Quay tool is a Python base script, that helps automate
the Quay deployment.
For example, there is some new Openstack release and each release
got own dedicated organization just for it. That requires actions:

- create organization,
- create `robot` user,
- create default permissions for robot user (prototype),
- create `creators` team that will allow create new repositories,
- add the robot user to the team.

All of those actions can be done by using the Quay Tool that is
communicating with the Quay API and perform required action.

The tool repository is available `here <https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/software-factory/python-quay-tool>`.

Example commands that you can find in the tool:


Set image to be public:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --token <token> --organization myorganization --visibility public

Specify image repository to be public:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --token <token> --organization myorganization --repository test --repository test2 --visibility public

Set all repository to be private, but skip some of them:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --token <token> --organization myorganization --skip test3 --skip test4 --visibility public

List all robots in organization:

.. code:: sh

   quay_tool --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --organization test --token sometoken --insecure --list-robots

Create robot in organization:

.. code:: sh

   quay_tool --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --organization test --token sometoken --create-robot bender

Set write permissions for a user for repositories inside the
organziation:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool  --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --organization test --token sometoken --user test+cirobot --set-permissions

Restore deleted tag:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --organization test --token sometoken--tag 14ee273e8565960cf6d5b6e26ae92ade --restore-tag

Set the prototype (default permissions) in the organization. By default
it creates prototype with write permissions.

For a user:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool  --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --organization test --token sometoken --create-prototype --user test+cirobot

For a team:

.. code:: sh

   quaytool  --api-url https://quay.dev/api/v1 --organization test --token sometoken --create-prototype --team creators

Pruner
------

The RDO team is using `pruner` scripts that is communicating with the DLRN (Delorian)
service to get the latest promotion hash, that later the images with tag
containing the hash will be skipped from the deletion.

The pruner script is usign Quay API. To communicate with the API, first you
need to create a dedicated application in Quay inside your organization with
following permissions:

- Administer Repositories,
- and View all visible repositories.

The pruner script used by the RDO project you can find `here <https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/software-factory/sf-infra/+/refs/heads/master/roles/rdo/quay/files/quay_tag_pruner.py>`.
Other scripts and crontab job you can find in the `sf-infra` project
in `roles/rdo/quay`.

Swagger
-------

Swagger is a suite of tools for API developers from SmartBear Software and
a former specification upon which the OpenAPI Specification is based.

You can start running the Swagger tool in the container and communicate
with Quay API.

How to start Swagger:

.. raw:: shell

   # Start swagger container
   podman run -p 8888:8080 -e API_URL=https://quay.dev/api/v1/discovery docker.io/swaggerapi/swagger-ui

   # If you are using local instance with firewall rules, you can tunel
   # the ssh connection and redirect the port
   # OPTIONAL
   ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 centos@quay.dev

After running abowe commands, you should be able to reach the swagger
Web UI interface on URL: `http://quay.dev:8080`.

More information how to use Swagger with Quay you can find `here <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/red_hat_quay_api_guide/using_the_red_hat_quay_api#accessing_your_quay_api_from_a_web_browser>`.

Example how to automate Quay organization deployment base on TripleO release
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RDO Project has automated project, users, robot, prototypes, etc. creation.
There is a dedicated `role <https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/software-factory/sf-infra/+/refs/heads/master/roles/rdo/quay-project-creation/>`.
Example, how to use that role:

.. raw:: yaml

  - hosts: quay.dev
    vars:
      quay_api_url: https://quay.dev/api/v1
      quay_organizations:
        myorganization:
          - name: somerepository
            token: ""
    tasks:
      - name: Configure Quay Organization
        include_role:
          name: rdo/quay-project-creation
          tasks_from: main.yml

Same actions can be perfomed without the Ansible role.
All steps are described in the `README file <https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/software-factory/python-quay-tool/+/refs/heads/master/README.md#basic-workflow-how-to-setup-new-organziation>`.

Documentation
-------------

Quay provides documentation that has also troubleshooting chapter.
The documentation you can find in `here <https://docs.quay.io/>`.
