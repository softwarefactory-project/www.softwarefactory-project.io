This article presents a plan for running Software Factory on OpenShift.

Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------

We are looking for solutions to the following list of pain points with the current system:

- Where are the services secrets, and how can I rotate them? This is a key requirement for auditing purpose.
- The plateform is overloaded, what is the process to increase the number of executors?
- Zuul is not voting on $change_url, what is going on? (the service logs are presently not centralized)
- What base system should I use, CentOS? Fedora? Debian?
- How can I run a pre-production deployment with a local checkout of the Zuul source code?
- sfconfig execution is slow, for example sf-project.io deployment takes more than one hour to converge.


Considered Options
------------------

- [option 1] Modularize the Ansible roles
- [option 2] Migrate to Kubernetes


Decision Outcome
----------------

We would like to investigate if and how Kubernetes can be a solution.
Here are the condition of satisfaction for the initial architecture:


Localhost configuration
.......................

When the user does not have a KUBECONFIG ready, sfconfig setup a single node cluster with `Kind <https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/>`_.
Then the system requires a working `kubectl` command.


Service deployment
..................

Using common manifests, the user can deploy custom architecture, for example *kubectl apply -f zuul+ci-log-processor.yaml*:

- Deploys: opensearch, zuul and ci log processor.
- Provides: zuul-web url and kibana url.


Developper mode
...............

Running *sfconfig develop ~/src/opendev.org/openstack/ci-log-processor* restart the ci-log-processor service using a local copy of the source.
See for example this guide:  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2430


Migration from sfconfig.yaml and arch.yaml
..........................................

There is a procedure to migrate the legacy system.
