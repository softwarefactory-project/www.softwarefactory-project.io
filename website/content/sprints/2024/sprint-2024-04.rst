Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We removed log  gearman - {client, worker}  in ci-log-processing project in logscraper and logsender due Opendev folks are not using it anymore (same as we)

* We fixed parsing fields in logsender after Opendev migrate to new Zuul

* We proposed to change the container base image to Centos 9 stream

* We pinned the python env version to 3.11 to avoid future issues with Python code

* We proposed a fix on zuul to support autoholds on changes hosted on gitlab (still wip, I'd like to test it on real data)

* We Fixed gitlab urls for weeder: https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/zuul-weeder/+/31049

* We have applied the ansible_fqcn_fixer.sh script to some of our repositories to ensure the use of fully qualified module names.

* We proposed a restore functionality in sf-operator

* We proposed a dedicated new job in sf-operator to verify environment after the disaster (verifying backup and restore functionality)
