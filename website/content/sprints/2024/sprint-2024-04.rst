Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We removed log  gearman - {client, worker}  in ci-log-processing project in logscraper and logsender due Opendev folks are not using it anymore (same as we)
* We fixed parsing fields in logsender after Opendev migrate to new Zuul
* We proposed to change the container base image to Centos 9 stream
* We pinned the python env version to 3.11 to avoid future issues with Python code
* We proposed a fix on zuul to support autoholds on changes hosted on gitlab (still wip, I'd like to test it on real data)

* We have applied the ansible_fqcn_fixer.sh script to some of our repositories to ensure the use of fully qualified module names.
* We proposed a restore functionality in sf-operator
