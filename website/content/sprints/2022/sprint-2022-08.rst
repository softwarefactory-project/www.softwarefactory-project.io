Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* zuul-client 0.1.0 was released.

* We added few patches into the logscraper and logsender tool that we found during applying new ci log workflow into the sf-config project (empty zuul job list infinity loop and move arg parser params into the config file)

* We create a docker account for opendev ci log processing project

* We added a CI job that is creating and pushing the container images into the docker registry

* We added a feature for logscraper to get some statistics that later will be available in Prometheus about job count


Software Factory
----------------

* We have released tags for our custom keycloak extensions after validating they work with keycloak 15:

    * github-ssh-mapper

    * mqtt-event-listener

* We worked on reactivating these extensions with containerized keycloak.

* We worked on moving log gearman client and worker to use logscraper and logsender (ci log processing log workflow) and it will also remove logstash service

* We are investigating how to deploy software factory on OpenShift using kubebuilder.
