Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We worked on pagination support for zuul search pages (builds & buildsets) - https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:%22web_results_pagination%22+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)

* All the web UI admin changes were merged

* We added support for arbitrary user to the gerritbot-matrix image

* We configured logscraper01.openstack.org to push openstack logs to testing Opensearch instance


Software Factory
----------------

* We started working on upgrading gerrit to version 3.4

* We published managesf on pypi for nodepool-ubi containers. We have also to publish python-sfmanager but it fails right now

* We are working to avoid to use update-ca-trust on zuul containers but instead use the bundle.crt from the host <- is that the same as the CA pb encountered on gerrit containers ? (yes, it's to prepare that)

* We are implementing support of keycloak in config-update, so that groups are synchronized with the resources in the config repo - maybe demo

* We move logstash and curator from package base deployment to containers

* We almost finish moving Opendistro (kibana, elasticsearch) to opensearch and opensearch dashboards base on the container service

* We create a python-builder container image, but after discussion we should create service container image simplier
