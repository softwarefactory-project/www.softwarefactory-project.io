Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We proposed a patch for Zuul that adds only those events to the zookeeper queue that will be later processed by zuul https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/822484

* Pagination was merged in zuul web ui before the holidays

* We got access to ibmcloud for reviewing a new nodepool driver

Software Factory
----------------

* We move Opendistro to Opensearch that will be running as container services

* We're working on improving keycloak integration - we will also support plugging external openidconnect IdPs to zuul, allowing for example using Red Hat SSO downstream even if keycloak integration isn't complete in SF.
