In this article, we will explain one of the most important features of Zuul:
the **dependent pipeline**, also known as the **gate pipeline**.

This article is part of the `Zuul hands-on series <{tag}zuul-hands-on-series>`_.

The examples and commands that follow are intended to be run on a Software Factory
sandbox where a **demo-repo** repository exists. You should have such an environment
after following the previous articles in this series:

- To deploy a Software Factory sandbox please read the `first article of the series <{filename}/blog-zuul-01-setup-sandbox.rst>`_.
- To create the **demo-repo** repository, please follow the sections `Clone the config repository <{filename}/blog-zuul-03-Gate-a-first-patch.rst#clone-the-config-repository>`_
  and `Define the demo-repo repository <{filename}/blog-zuul-03-Gate-a-first-patch.rst#define-the-demo-repo-repository>`_ sections.

Incidentally, most of the links reference *sftests.com* which is the default
domain of the sandbox. Make sure to adapt the links if necessary.

If you have already deployed a Software Factory sandbox and created a snapshot as
suggested, you can restore this snapshot in order to follow this article on a clean environment.
In that case make sure the virtual machine's time is correct post
restoration. If not fix it by running

.. code-block:: bash

  systemctl stop ntpd; ntpd -gq; systemctl start ntpd

The broken master phenomenon
............................

Keeping the master branch sane can be difficult when:

- validating a patch takes a long time (eg. complex test suite)
- the amount of patches proposals submitted to a project is quite high

Until now, the best practices to mitigate these problems were to enforce the following:

- run continuous builds and test suites on master after each commit or as often
  as possible
- have several maintainers granted with the power to reject or accept patches
  into the project's master branch

These best practices, however, do **not** guarantee the health of the master branch
*at any given time*. Let's consider this very common scenario on a project with
two maintainers, **M1** and **M2**:

#. **M1** reviews change **A** before integration: s.he applies **A** to the current tip of the
   master branch (**HEAD+A**) and tests the code. After testing succeeds, **M1** refreshes the
   master branch, commits and pushes **A** to the remote central repository.
#. In the time it took **M1** to test and push **A**, **M2** had approved change **B** and pushed
   it to the remote repository. This means the master branch history is actually **HEAD+B+A**,
   instead of **HEAD+A** as it was validated by **M1**.
#. Unfortunately, **B** has side effects on **A** and the master branch is no longer building or
   passing tests.

In other words the master branch is **broken**, and everybody working on the project
is impacted in some way, either because their own code won't build, or because they
have to figure out the problem and fix it.

Sure, continuous builds help catch the problem as soon as possible, but if
building and running tests are costly operations in time and/or resources, and
therefore aren't performed after every commit, how many patches might have landed
since the breakage, making it even more difficult to pinpoint the change that caused
the issue?

One could also object that maintainers just have to always make sure to
validate patches on the latest version of the master branch, but it might just
be too hard to enforce manually in projects where commits can occur faster than
testing or building. One would have to implement some form of "merging semaphore",
meaning that maintainers would have to wait on each other, beating the purpose of
having several of them in the first place.

But what if we could avoid that trouble altogether and **guarantee** by design
of the integration pipeline that the master branch can pass tests and build *at all times*?

Zuul, the gate keeper
.....................

The trick is to deport the merging powers of the maintainers to a **single, automated
"gate keeper"**. Maintainers approve patches for merging, and the gate keeper makes
sure they can land without breaking the master branch.

Enter **Zuul**:

Thanks to its gate pipeline, Zuul decides whether a patch can be merged
into the master branch or not, by ensuring the patch is always tested over the
latest version of master prior to merging. This pipeline is designed to avoid
breaking the master branch.

The gate pipeline takes care of the git rebases in order
to run CI job(s) on the expected state of the master at the time the patch will
be merged. This is called **speculative testing**. Let's see how it changes the
previous scenario, this time in chronological order:

#. Maintainer **M2** approves change **B** for merging. Zuul gates it by running the acceptance
   tests on **HEAD+B**.
#. Maintainer **M1** approves change **A** for merging as Zuul is still in the process of
   gating **B**. Zuul gates it by running the acceptance tests on **HEAD+B+A**. This is where the
   speculation bit occurs, since **B** isn't in master yet but is *expected* to land before **A**,
   *assuming its gating ends with success*.
#. Testing on **HEAD+B** succeeds, **B** is merged into the master branch.
#. Testing on **HEAD+B+A** fails, **A** is rejected. The maintainer or **A**'s author must
   rework it.

(for simplicity's sake, we'll call acceptance tests, builds, and generally any kind
of automation used to validate a patch *"jobs"*.)

The gate pipeline ensures that the merging order of patches
is the same as their approval order. If jobs for change **B**, that is on top
of the gate pipeline, are still running when all jobs for change **A** have
succeeded, then zuul will wait for **B**'s jobs to finish to merge **B**
then **A**.

What happens if **B** is rejected, though? The gate pipeline is able to discard
failing patches and rebase subsequent changes in order to optimize testing time.
For example, let's imagine changes **A**, **B** and **C** have entered the gate
pipeline in that order, and that a job fails when **B** is on top of **A**. The
pipeline will evolve like so:

#. - HEAD + A
   - HEAD + A + B
   - HEAD + A + B + C

#. - HEAD + A
   - HEAD + A + B **FAIL**
   - HEAD + A + B + C **CANCELED**

#. - HEAD + A
   - HEAD + A + C **REBASED AND RESTARTED**

Instead of waiting for **C**'s jobs that will propably fail as **B** introduced
an issue, Zuul immediately cancels **C**'s jobs, rebases **C** on **A** and restarts **C**'s
jobs. Zuul reports the issue for **B** on the code review system.

Let's test it
.............

We are going to:

- define the **demo-repo** project's pipelines
- modify the project's tox configuration to add some delaying in the CI process
- submit and approve three patches to simulate how Zuul detects a future broken
  master and discards the broken patch.

Setup CI jobs
,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clone the **demo-repo** and provision it with
`this demo code <{filename}/demo-codes/hoz-4-demo-repo.tgz>`_ .

First, in **.zuul.yaml**, define the project's pipelines. We use the virtual job
**noop** in the check pipeline to force Zuul to return a positive CI note
**+1 Verified**.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - project:
      check:
        jobs:
          - noop
      gate:
        jobs:
          - tox-py27

Second, create the script **trigger.sh** in order to better highlight the
gate pipeline's specificities in the status page. It adds some delay in the job's
execution time based on the existence of some files at the root of the project.

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/bin/bash

  if [ -f c3 ]; then
      sleep 20
      exit 0
  fi
  if [ -f c2 ]; then
      exit 0
  fi
  if [ -f c1 ]; then
      sleep 90
      exit 0
  fi

We make sure this script runs prior to unit testing by modifying the
**tox.ini** file as indicated below.

.. code-block:: ini

  [tox]
  envlist = pep8,py27

  [testenv]
  whitelist_externals = *
  deps = nose
  commands =
    ./trigger.sh
    nosetests -v

  [testenv:pep8]
  deps = flake8
  commands = flake8

Finally, submit the change on Gerrit:

.. code-block:: bash

  chmod +x trigger.sh
  git add -A .
  git commit -m"Init demo-repo pipelines"
  git review

Do not forget to approve the patch to let it land.

Run the scenario
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this scenario we propose three changes:

- The first change (**A**) changes the value returned by the run method.
- The second change (**B**) adds a test to verify the length of the string returned
  by the run method is less than ten characters. This change simulates a
  situation where the unit tests pass when based on the tip of master
  but fail when rebased on (**A**).
- The third patch (**C**) adds a README.md file to the project. Its purpose
  is to see how Zuul rebases it on (**A**), once the issue with (**B**) is
  detected.

Patches are available in `this archive <{filename}/demo-codes/hoz-5-patches.tgz>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Reset local copy to the base commit
  git reset --hard $(git log --pretty=oneline | grep "Init demo-repo pipelines" | awk {'print $1'} | head -1)
  git am ../A.patch && git review -i

  # Reset local copy to the base commit
  git reset --hard HEAD^1
  git am ../B.patch && git review -i

  # Reset local copy to the base commit
  git reset --hard HEAD^1
  git am ../C.patch && git review -i


In the gate pipeline, before merging the changes, Zuul will test them speculatively.

Let's approve all of them in the right order.

.. code-block:: bash

  cmsgs=("Change run payload" "Add payload size test" "Add project readme file"); for msg in $cmsgs; do rn=$(python -c "import sys,json,requests;from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning;requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning);changes=json.loads(requests.get('https://sftests.com/r/changes/', verify=False).text[5:]); m=[c for c in changes if c['subject'] == sys.argv[1]][0]; print m['_number']" $msg); echo "Set change approval (CR+2 and W+1) on change $rn,1"; ssh -p 29418 admin@sftests.com gerrit review $rn,1 --code-review +2 --workflow +1; done


Then have a look at `Zuul's status page (sftests.com) <https://sftests.com/zuul/t/local/status.html>`_.

.. image:: images/zuul-hands-on-part5-c1.png



You should soon observe that Zuul has canceled the running job for **C**, and rebased
it on change **A** as **B** introduces an issue when rebased on **A**. Zuul won't
merge **B** but will report the failure on Gerrit; **A** and **C** will build successfully
and be merged.

Let's have a look at the Zuul Scheduler's logs (*/var/log/zuul/scheduler.log*):

The executor is told to start the tox-py27 job for change 25 (rebased on 24)

Conclusion
..........

Zuul's **dependent pipeline** is an elegant way to ensure the health of code
repositories at all times, allowing developers to focus on more important things like
new features, and expanding and automating test coverage.

In this article, we showcased a simple use case but the features of the
**dependent pipeline** also apply to complex project testing scenarios
(supported by Zuul) like:

- multiple, parallelized jobs
- cross projects testing
- multi nodes jobs

This concludes this article about the **gate pipeline**. Stay tuned for the
next article about Zuul secrets usage.
