High level overview of Software Factory
=======================================

Zuul and Nodepool are at the core of Software Factory.

* Zuul is a job scheduler/runner.
* Nodepool is the node provisioner on which Zuul executes jobs.

Software Factory provides a fully functional Zuul and Nodepool platform out of
the box through default settings and addionnal (optional) components like
a logserver or an ELK stack. These components are deployed and configured to
efficiently integrate with Zuul and Nodepool.

Software Factory components
===========================

The diagram, below, shows the deployed components as part of Software Factory.
Grey boxes are mandatory components and blue boxes are optional components.

Mandatory components
--------------------

These components are essential parts of Software Factory and are installed as
part of every deployment.

* Apache: HTTP frontend on top of the APIs and serve WEB UI.
* Zuul: The job scheduler and runner that is used to define and run jobs.
* Nodepool: Zuul's companion pool manager that provides clean
  and re-producible node contexts to Zuul for job execution.
* Zookeeper: The distributed database for Zuul and Nodepool.
* MariaDB: SQL database backend.

Optional components
-------------------

* Gerrit: A git hosting and code review service.
* Logserver: A simple job logs/artifacts storage and publication service.
* ELK: The ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana stack. It can be used to
  index job's artifacts and search through.
* ARA: Service to create comprehensive html Zuul/Ansible job execution reports.
* Log-analyse: Service to ease anomalies detection on job failures based on
  baselines of previous succeeded jobs.
* Code-Search: Service that provides a code search accross git repositories
  hosted by Software Factory.
* repoXplorer: Service that provides metrics on code contributions.
* Storyboard: A story/issue tracker.
* cgit: A fast git repositories web browser.
* Grafana/InfluxDB: The stack that provide Software Factory usage metrics.
* Paste: A pastie like service.
* Etherpad: A collaborative editor.
* Mumble: An audio chat service.

Software Factory can integrate with existing Code Review systems such as Gerrit
or Github as well as regular Git source code repositories.

Software Factory relies on a *config* git repository
(configuration as code) where configuration is validated and deployed via
Zuul. Two Zuul jobs handle this configuration as code workflow:

* The *config-chek* job ensures the proposed configuration is valid before the
  configuration change is merged.
* The *config-update* job deploys, after review and approval,
  the configuration on Software Factory. For instance, a change on the
  Nodepool configuration, will be deployed on the Nodepool services
  and services will be reload without any operator intervention.

Zuul/Nodepool
-------------

The architecture
................

This diagram shows Zuul and Nodepool's components as well as external
services involved in the architecture.

.. image:: images/zuul-nodepool-arch.png

Zuul receives events from code review systems which act as source stimuli
from which Zuul makes job triggering decisions.

Example events:

* Pull-Request/Review created,
* Pull-Request/Review updated,
* Pull-Request/Review commented,
* Pull-Request/Review merged,
* Tag created,
* ...

The Zuul's scheduler, based on its configuration and the received events,
requests services from other Zuul components:

* Zuul's mergers prepare project(s)'s (to be tested) source code by
  rebasing or merging the PR/Code-review X on top of master branch of
  the repository.
* Zuul's executors, prepare the Ansible workspace, and run ansible-playbook
  against the test node(s).
* The Zuul web service provides the REST API. The API is mainly used by
  the Zuul UI to provide jobs execution status and projects configuration
  overview.

The Gearman bus is the communication channel between Zuul's services.

Nodepool manages nodes/containers' lifecycle and communicates with the
Zuul scheduler via the Zookeeper service. Zookeeper stores node requests and
statuses. Zuul stores a node request in Zookeeper to acquire a node for a job
execution. Nodepool's launchers look for requests and fullfil them
by spawning a node or a container on the PaaS/CaaS or static node provider.
Nodepool destroys the ephemeral node(s) after the job(s) execution.

Furthermore, Nodepool is able to build cloud images from a Disk Image Builder
definition. When a new image is created, Nodepool uploads it to each cloud
provider configured.

Job execution workflow
......................

This sequence diagram shows Zuul and Nodepool components involved in
the run of a single job from the trigger stimuli (the Code-Review proposed
patch), to the job result returned to the patch author.

.. image:: images/zuul-nodepool-workflow.png
   :alt: None

1. An event is received (PR/Review created/updated).
2. Zuul requests a node from Nodepool in order to execute a job.
3. Nodepool reserves an existing one or spawns a new node and notifies
   that the node is available.
4. Zuul executor runs the job (an Ansible playbook) against the node.
5. Zuul releases the node to be deleted.

If multiple jobs are configured to be run, then the scheduler will request
the corresponding amount of nodes to Nodepool. A single job may require
multiple nodes (multi-nodes job), Zuul will fullfil the requirement by
requesting the resources to Nodepool.

Note that fresh nodes are requested from Nodepool for each job execution. This
ensures an healthy workspace and reduces job flakiness. Furthermore Nodepool
is quota awared then it is capable of notifying Zuul to wait for resources
to become available.

Now look at how the executor handles a job execution.

.. image:: images/zuul-executor-workflow.png
   :alt: None

* Zuul executor creates an Ansible workspace with:

  - An inventory file
  - The playbooks (pre-run, run, post-run)
  - Additional roles (pull from git repositories)
  - Fetch dependant repositories

* Zuul Ansible runs Ansible playbooks (job phases) isolated in bubblewrap

  - pre-run

    + push source code on the test node
    + validate the test node

  - run

    + unittest
    + functional test
    + code style
    + ...

  - post-run

    + build the job ARA report
    + export the logs/artifacts to the logserver
    + export the logs/artifacts to the ELK stack

Architecture of Zuul job
........................

A Zuul job is a YAML definition that describes (non-exhaustive list):

* The job name.
* Its parent job.
* The required Ansible roles for the job playbooks.
* The secrets required (if any) (i.e.: passwords/private keys).
* The nodeset, required Nodepool nodes for the job playbooks.
* The pre-run phase: the preparation playbook (if any).

  - Any actions that must be performed before the real
    job such as installing dependencies.

* The run phase: the job playbook.
* The post-run phase: the post action playbook.

  - Any action that must be performed after the real
    job such as artifacts retrieval.

Below is the Zuul *base* job created as part of a standard Software Factory
installation:

.. code-block:: YAML

  - job:
      name: base
      parent: null
      description: The base job.
      pre-run: playbooks/base/pre.yaml
      post-run:
        - playbooks/base/post.yaml
      roles:
        - zuul: sf-jobs
        - zuul: zuul-jobs
      timeout: 1800
      attempts: 3
      secrets:
        - site_sflogs
      nodeset:
        nodes:
          - name: container
            label: runc-centos

The pre-run playbook is used to synchronize repository sources to the test node.
The post-run playbook is used to fetch artifacts from the test node,
copy them to the log server and index them into ELK.

This base job may be simply inherited by any other job.

.. code-block:: YAML

  - job:
      name: tox-pep8
      parent: base
      description: Run tox pep8
      run: playbooks/tox.yaml
      vars:
        target: pep8
